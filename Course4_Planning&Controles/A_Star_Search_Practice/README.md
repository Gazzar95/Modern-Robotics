A* Search Practice

This repository contains multiple implementations of the A* search algorithm written from memory as part of my effort to build both algorithmic intuition and foundational Python programming skills.
Purpose

    Algorithm Mastery: Reinforce a deep understanding of the A* search algorithm by rewriting it repeatedly from scratch.

    Python Fundamentals: Practice core Python concepts such as dictionaries, lists, conditionals, loops, and function structure in the context of a practical problem.

    Memory-Based Learning: Each script was written without referencing previous implementations to solidify internalization of the algorithm's logic and flow.

What's Inside

    Variants of the A* algorithm coded manually in Python.

    Minor differences in implementation to explore different logic flows and internal design decisions.

    No external libraries used beyond Python standard libraries.

Notes

This is not a polished or production-ready module. It is a learning-focused space meant to:

    Strengthen understanding of pathfinding

    Improve programming fluency through repetition

    Track progress over time
