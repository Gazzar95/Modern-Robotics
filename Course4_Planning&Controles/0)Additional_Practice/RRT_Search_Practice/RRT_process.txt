recalling from memory how to do RRT process to help internalize:

1. define parameters
2. create nodes and edges lists
3. need to create: x_samp, x_nearest, x_new. Then cycle through
    1. x_samp
        1. generate random num bet 0 & 1
            1. if <.1 make x_samp = x_goal
            2. else make x_samp = (random.uniform(x_limit), …)
    2. x_nearest
        1. calc shortest distance dist for all nodes
        2. create if statement to get shortest dist
        3. make x_nearest = node with shortest dist
    3. x_new
        1. calculate angle theta for strait line from x_nearest to x_samp
        2. calculate x_new at a predefined distance 
4. Check if x_new 
    1. is within defined limits
    2. doesn’t collide with obstacles
5. save x_new to Node list &
