# Modern Robotics Coursework

ðŸ“š Exercises and assignments from the [Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics) specialization by Northwestern University.

## What it is  
This repository contains my solutions to the six-course specialization, including the final capstone project, aligned with Kevin Lynch's textbook. Implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Why it matters  
Completing this program strengthened my theoretical and computational understanding of robotics, covering kinematics, dynamics, motion planning, and control. Itâ€™s a cornerstone in my transition from mechanical engineering to robotics.

> **Time commitment:** ~4â€“6 months at 8â€“10 hours/week, totaling approximately 150â€“200 hours of focused study and implementation.
